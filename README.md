# RemoveImageBackground
### Using this we can remove the background of any jpg and jpeg image and save the image in png format.
### In this we use rembg (python library used to remove the image backgrounds) and 
### PIL (Python Imaging Library it enables python to deal with image)
In this we also change the o/p image name and the i/p directer according to your choice.
